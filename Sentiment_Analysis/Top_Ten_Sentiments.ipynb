      "2.) 5/20/20Trash, it sucks it covered in fake profiles, premium snap, give me money, then when you finally get somebody there 1000 miles from know where. Right when you run out, boom all normal profiles. 1/12/21 so many spam profiles,, SPAM SPAM SPAM TRASSH TRASSSSH TRASSH SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAMSPAMSPAMSPAMSPAMSPAMSPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM\n",

DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT USE THIS APP! IF YOU PAID TO USE A PREMIUM SERVICE YOU BETTER CANCEL YOUR CARD AND ORDER ANOTHER! YOUR CARD IS NOW COMPROMISED! THEY WILL HIT YOUR CARD DOWN THE ROAD! IM WARNING YOU NOW! DO NOT USE TINDER! SCAM! SCAM! SCAM! SCAM! SCAM! SCAM! SCAM! SCAM! SCAM! SCAM! SCAM! SCAM! SCAM!\n",
      "\n",
      "4.) Fake Fraudelent app full of scam people and fake profiles, they only want you to pay so you can get matches, worst app ever add to that the non-resonable termination that happens without doing anything. All of what you get are scam people using pics from instagram or facebook to trick you, especially in some regions where they will start asking for stupid dumb things like phone credit and money scams, stupid fraud fake spam scam terrible app, you have to pay a fortune to get real matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.) I had a premium paid membership for a good while and I was on tinder daily but then for no reason, no explanation, no response, and no refund I was completely , wrongfully, and disgustingly banned completely!!! I am so pissed and disappointed and irate that I wish I could give 0 stars or half a star I mean I spent over 100.00 dollars for the year membership and boom banned and no explanation nothing!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "6.) Tinder violates boundaries keeps spamming us with fake profiles we block! Repeatedly when I report & block tinder profiles which are spam dishonest profiles - accounts , Tinder then aggressively violates my boundaries by aggressively repeatedly spamming me with the same exact accounts- profiles I reported as spam!!! Making Tinder itself abusive scam and spam\n",
      "\n",
      "7.) This was previously rated 2 stars since it let you see both men and women. But the nut jobs here banned my account because I had pictures of my stomach showing abs and fully clothed pictures showing my butt(claiming I \"violated the terms or service or community guidelines). The \"support\" seems to be nothing more than automated responses since I couldn't even get an answer as to what part of the ToS I violated the first time I did it.  I figured maybe I violated the part where you can only put pictures of yourself- which is what I did but maybe they didn't think my butt pictures were me(I have been told I have a chick's butt) so I took some more pictures of my abs and butt. This time, in the same place, wearing the same clothes(a tank top and gym shorts, nothing revealing or sexy) leaving no way to mistake that it was the same person in the picture.  They banned me so that means all I can assume now is that showing your stomach or fully clothed butt is a violation of the ToS for being sexually explicit. You've got to be kidding me.  I know that that's impossible because DAMN NEAR EVERYONE ELSE shows their stomach or butt. If I could give negative stars I would.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.) I was brutally raped and nearly killed by someone off this App and the response from Tinder has been abhorrent. They REFUSED to help Police, would not respond my emails, ignored my Tweets, their exec team ignored multiple communications begging them to help catch this guy. Eventually, and only once they were forced to help by Police (which took FOUR months) my violent attacker got away and my case is now dead. This happens often on Tinder and a TV doc was made about it. Fake apology below FU!\n",
      "\n",
      "9.) App is gud but many people re using tinder by fake profiles nd lots of frauds re happening, I ve seen lots of people re cheating to each other or one person is cheating to another match ,dis is very wrong, people should aware of it ,mostly tinder should provide something that person should put his or her own pics ,while putting different pics person cnt understand who is it ,its a boy or a girl or it can be a fake ,fraud nd cheaters profile\n",
      "\n",
      "10.) I recieved an error 40303 saying there was a problem logging into my account. Try again later.   I messaged tinder and they got back to me with a cookie cutter response saying I violated the terms so they terminated my account. But i hadn't. I looked thru the terms and I hadn't violated a single thing. Nor had I done anything that should have provoked anyone to report me as a bot or evil man.   They say I am never allowed to use tinder again and my Facebook account is blocked from using the app.   Oddly enough, I had purchased the one month of tinder 9 days ago. Not really long enough to do anything incredibly stupid. The other morning the app glitched hardcore. My messages were out of order, all the messages said they were unread, and all the matches I hadn't talked to yet were not viewed. Nothing would load so I logged out.   But now I am unable to log back in and they blocked my account. Customer service rep Cynthia is absolutely zero help and sends prefabed messages and probably didn't read a thing I sent.  Tinder: 1. worst costumer service and claims to take their users safety as a priority yet I was probably hacked and punished because of it.  2. Won't refund my month  3. Won't talk to me like a human 4. Obviously has a problem with hackers or has a major glitch seeing that I am not the only person to experience this problem.  Google error 40303 and you'll find that many people are kicked off tinder without real cause and without remorse. It is impossible to talk to someone capable of solving a problem within their own company.\n",

      "1.) As a man, as a gay man, my personal experience with this app isn't indicative of everyone's experience on here. I feel like each gender, each sexuality, each person will have their own unique experience- most of which will be rather poor and uneventful. Unless you're a girl or are extremely attractive, most matches you get will be by people who are lukewarm toward you. This means that, sure, you've matched with them, but you'll never get a response. And the reason people like you when they may not be interested is because the app is designed to make people do that. The app will tell you whenever you missed a match, but here's the thing- if you didn't like them in the first place, what makes their desire change anything? Okay, this person likes me, but I don't like them so... Why bother telling me? The app preys on peoples' desire for attention. \"Ohhh! Someone likes me, don't I feel desired.\" And that's really what the app boils down to- attention. This app is less a dating app, and more like an ego boost for people who have low self-esteem. I don't have low self-esteem, so I really didn't care *how* many people liked me, but rather *who* I had mutual interest in. And that's where the app fails. The app primarily focuses on physical attractiveness. You look at pictures first, and then, if you want, check what they've written about themselves. And, just like in every dating app forever, people make themselves out to be the most bland milktoast boring person possible when writing about themselves so as not to scare any possible hookup away. \"Oh, you know, I just like watching movies, and I love dogs, and laughing!\" Brenda, most everyone loves those things- tell us about how you enjoy putting mayonnaise on your pickles, much to everyone's disgust. But, none of that really matters, since this app is designed to be a superficial ego-boost platform. I matched with a number of people, but was only ever able to talk to a few- and of those few I went on two dates. Neither worked out, because both were looking for things that I was genuinely not interested in- AND I would have known this if their profiles were more than \"loves to laugh, hike, and pet doggos.\" Look, online dating already sucks, and Tinder makes it that much worse. I wouldn't recommend it unless you need the ego boost. Post the most flattering pictures you have, probably of you in remote locations to give the impression that you have the time/money to jetset, and write about how you love to hike, and laugh, and love dogs. Boom, people will like you, but good luck getting a decent relationship out of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.) I pay for it. Tl;dr I think the 14+ dollars I pay per month for Tinder Plus and Tinder Gold is worth the amount of time I sink into it.  So, long version. You get 100 swipes in a 12hr period for free. And that's cool if it's like a weekend or something or it's popping during the weekday. I will say that it is worth paying for if you care about having as many low effort convos that either lead to casual sex or something serious. There's nothing guaranteed, but casting the net wide is a wise idea, if you care. Let's say your goal is sex, but you're using the app for free. If you're a woman this really doesn't matter too much because people of any gender will swipe on women regardless of how they are in the looks department, I'm not sure too many people care about bios (I do because I'm a bit selective), but you can take this advice too if you are. Two words: SAMPLE SIZE. Maybe that's the wrong terminology - I'm not a math guy - but the point is whatever the population of the area using the app you are broadcasting in will determine the ratio. Layman's terms: Chicago has like 3 million people. Assume at least 200,000 people are using the app at the same time. That's 1:200,000. If you only have 100 swipes, there is a HIGH chance you will BOTH not get a match on your end (swiping) and not be seen. When you pay for Tinder Plus, you get infinite likes for a month ( you get other stuff too I think, look it up). And that's really cool. However that doesn't solve the problem completely. You still don't know who has swiped on you. Remember, it takes two for this to work ( not to mention you can't message people directly on Tinder.). That problem is solved with Tinder Gold (sounds like a meme, right? Well it ain't). With Tinder Gold you can see who likes you already, swipe on them, and voila you've got a match! As an added bonus, with the Boost option that you get it will broadcast you on every single Tinder app within whatever mile radius you prescribe thereby increasing your visibility. Think of it as putting you to the top of the stack. I've met, smashed, and dated a bunch of girls here that I probably otherwise wouldn't have without it (I don't do so great in social settings, but I have no anxiety online.). So, uh, yeah, try it out or whatever and look things up for yourself because I'm 90% sure I'm forgetting a few things lol\n",
      "\n",
      "3.) I've used Tinder on and off for several years and I've noticed the following: 1 - It's gotten ridiculously expensive over the years. I've just paid £26.99 per month for a GOLD membership on 1 month plan. My friend too has GOLD membership and he only pays £7.99, how can this cost be justified? We are both on Android platform and same handset type (SAMSUNG). Can someone at Tinder please explain how this is possible and is this really fair conning people like this? 2 - The algorithm absolutely designed to ensure you have several matches in the first couple days of paying for a subscription and then after that, you pretty much get no matches or BOTS matches. Any justification for this? Why not relax the algorithms and let people actually get matches by those who they like? 3 - I understand you are trying to make as much revenue as you can for the company, but, seriously, having 2 types of membership i.e Tinder Plus and Tinder Gold is seriously extremely pointless. If TinderPlus is the cheapest, then charging 2x the price for the GOLD should technically give you more \"Super Likes\" as well as more \"Boost\" ability. Again, this sounds like a total con, cause you pay £26.99 for GOLD membership and you dont even get any extra boosts or super likes, so what is the only difference? You just get to know which girl liked your profile and it turns out that its a BOT account. 4 - I've been on many dating app platforms and I can confirm Tinder is by far the worst when it comes to being matched by a BOTS. Seriously, Tinder you really need to act fast and take a look into this as this is a serious matter. BOTS trying to divert people away to scamming sites and I'm sure there will be some newbies who will fall for this trap and again this is not fair on them really? All in all, Tinder has some of the most beautiful girls compared to other app's, however, there are several flaws with this application and pricing is the biggest put off factor. If there is only 1 thing that Tinder is going to reply to this post, please make sure its an answer to \"How is GOLD membership and PLUS membership showing different prices for ME vs My Friend?\". Thanks\n",
      "\n",
      "4.) Platinum membership is amazing sending super likes with a message to people you like has made tinder better and the best part is, is you get 5 free super likes every day. (UPDATE) tinder has decided to change from getting 5 free super likes everyday to only getting 5 free super likes once a week this is 100% not worth 20$ a month I am canceling my membership until they go back to 5 free super likes a day.\n",

      "6.) Well, thank you Tinder for being so kind to me.. I enjoy seeing all the beautiful women in this world... Lots I COULD spend my entire life with forever and ever but that's impossible... but it's also worth making friends all around too... I'm still having fun exploring and wishing and hope I can meet a beautiful woman that ends up loving me back someday and just making very good friends with some too... Thank you again! :)\n",

      "\n",
      "8.) Great app and here is why..  First off it Got me LAID!! Well not me, but a friend.  More of an old acquaintance actually. Not mine of course, sort of a buddy my friend had heard about who used to hang out with some real happening people. I definitely recommend this app over others because its just so bright and the sounds are very futuristic. To be honest I thought this was the survival how-to app for 25 to 34 year old man children. I was wrong. The actual app I was looking for doesn't exist I'm lying again. In fact I'm so desperate for attention, I'm reaching out to the dating app review community for a potential partner. So here it goes.   Something about me. I'm never good at these things lol. People always tell me how laid back and funny I am. I really enjoy the outdoors, things like hiking, kayaking or as I like to call it \"cryacking\". Lol JK that's just my funny sense of humor coming out. I'm actually a very down to earth and sensitive guy.  Some if not most nights of mine are spent alone pondering some of life's most deep and meaningful questions. Yet I have no answers. Maybe someone special with  a very vague opinion of things could recommend a good app or even suggest some mediocre forums.  So since I completely forgot what I was doing I will cut to what appears to be the point. Tinder was alot of fun and the people I have attempted to reach out to seem very happy. I don't recommend this app for anyone seeking instructions in the art of fire starting.\n",

      "10.) I downloaded Tinder as a joke, really. Then I realized it is AMAZING. The match system is seriously awesome... I've been on a few online meeting apps (I guess dating apps, but I like making friends, not one night stands) and women get harassed and spammed by men regularly.... Which in the end scares them off. Tinder put that into consideration and made something truly amazing. Although I did accidently set up my Instagram which caused some issues... But as long as you keep that information off, it is perfect! I've met a few really awesome people with similar interests to me. Perfect for everyone, in my opinion. Friends? Got it. Dating? Perfect. Hook ups? Yup. It's really your choice. You have to choose the people you talk to... So there's no creeps stalking you without you approving them (or \"matching\"). It even picks your theme song based off your Spotify play history if you don't pick one yourself... Or maybe it allows someone to pick it for you. I'm unsure. But mine was perfect. Recommended.\n",

      "1.) Horrible app. They give bare minimum to claim its free everything is a push to make you pay. It's full of outdated inactive accounts and fake accounts. Used to be good but now it is very scammy.. If I could give 0 stars I would. EDIT after bumble's response to my review above: bumble's focus on my review is is only on suspicious accounts and reporting them. they ignore the rest of my review. no addressing bumble's scam nature, the outdated accounts, bumble's behavior and how the app has degraded into a dumpster fire over time. Just another dishonest company. 0 stars given. Bumble is Horrible. just in the couple days since my review the average review for bumble has dropped well over 1 star. whoever is in charge is driving the flaming garbage truck known as bumble off a ravine. really is a shame once it was a good app. now i'ts no different than match, meetme, or any of the other scam type dating apps. i had even paid for service last year and even after canceling per instructions they still renewed/charged me and took a while to get my money back. these days their daily likes you can give seem random one day you will get 10 likes for the whole day.. over 24 hrs later you've still \"reached your limit for the day\" the number of likes you can give seems very inconsistent and manipulative to get you to pay for a service that isn't worth it. my advice ... abandon ship.. stay away... never give em a penny.. learn from other's mistakes, from my experience they're dishonest. it's a scam. do research online on them before installing. just a little research will show the opinion they are a scam is common.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.) Hate this app! The worst I think I ever made even more worse then tinder!! I made three different accounts in the last month and I get banned for nothing at all! These stupid cash cows just take you're money and tey to make you make a new one it's a scam and fake. Most girls on there are bots and never message you, if they do there ugly or fat or have issues. It's pathetic these days apps are all scams and fake. Why do I get banned Its stupid as hell when I do nothing, save you're money!\n",
      "\n",
      "3.) This app sucks. Period Sucks Suck Suck Suck suck Sucks Is the worst End of the line for today? But make me wait for more then 24....why the hell for Sucks Sucks Sucks Suck Suck Suck Garbage\n",
      "\n",
      "4.) Disappointed, as a Black Professional, I was constantly bombarded with Negative Racist Accounts from Men that did not live in my area but used there paid \"Travel Mode\" feature to harass me with their racist profile remarks and negative images. Any Black Person should not be supporting this Racist Platform. Men asking for the Women to make the first move is also a key sign to run away... the Men appeared very self-centered and not friendly. Policy isn't in App bc they know they are doing wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.) Scam, fraud, illiegal charges. These are words that describe my experience with Bumble. I might have swiped a couple of times to message people or special message someone, but 2 years after I last even visited the app, I started to notice that small charges were on my bank account, spread out over long periods of time equaling over $325. When I contacted my bank, to dispute the charges, it was already too late to dispute some of the charges because they happened so long ago. The charges do not appear as Bumble on my bank statement, but \"social payments sanfran\" or something similar therefore, I thought that it was a babysitting app or venmo that I was paying for. Complete fraud, and I am not sure how federal regulators and law enforcement has not yet caught them. I cannot be the only one Bumble has stolen from. Horrible experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.) I paid for a boost for 1 week & cancelled the subscription straight away. \n",
      "The boost didn't work kept saying something went wrong. Emailed bumble \n",
      "shocking service stating they can't find an account, asked for screen shots \n",
      "of bumble & my face book. Still couldn't find it in the end I sent a pic of \n",
      "my bank statement, told them I made sure I cancelled it as per their \n",
      "t's&c's to prevent future subscription & all of a sudden they found my \n",
      "account and reactivated boost for 1 week & said I need to cancel \n",
      "subscription in Google play or on bumble. I tried both options sent screen \n",
      "shots as there was no option to cancel on play or bumble, confirmed no \n",
      "further money is to come out, as I cancelled immediately after paying for \n",
      "the service I couldn't use originally & told them there is no option to \n",
      "cancel subscription. They tell me they are doing everything they can to \n",
      "help in a polite way & as per t's&c's I must cancel. They clearly have not \n",
      "read my emails as, I originally cancelled my subscription, I tried again in \n",
      "the 2 ways they said but no option to cancel then they are referring me too \n",
      "their t's&c's shocking they are telling instructions, I follow them but \n",
      "cannot cancel no option shocking service. Will not provide me with \n",
      "complaints team details do not use, I sent screen shots of the error still \n",
      "getting when I press certain things something went wrong let's try again \n",
      "pathetic they just ignore what you say.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.) So I'm normally not a person to leave a review for anything, but I simply cant help myself in this case. This is one of the worst apps I've ever had the displeasure of using to meet people, and I am a people person so I know what's out there. For starters the layout is bad, the aesthetic feels cheep, but who cares about how it looks if it's a good app right? This is my problem with bumble, on bumble bff I am only shown people of the same gender as me, like seriously? What is this 1955?!? I'm I incapable of holding a plutonic relationship with another human being because they are female? The amount of disrespect that implies is atrocious, yet I switched to the dating part to see if the developer of the app aren't completely insane, females literally have to make the first move. Now it's not as bad as the bubmblebff part (mind you bumblebff is such a stupid name) because they tell you this on the app store with \"females always make the first move\" honestly what a bad idea it really shows you the mindset these developers have. This is an app obviously targeted to a generation this shouldn't bother, another thing the app profile settings are very \"boxy\" they try and force you to pick only one thing, for example under pets you have options like \"dog(s), cat(s), and other animals, with the final option just being \"lots.\" Now this wouldn't normally be a problem but your forced to only pick one, what if I have a cat and a dog, that's only 2 pets, who would consider that alot? To make it worse all options on your profile are riddled with examples like these. No reasonable person can or should be boxed into the obviously stereotypical lives these developers think everyone lives. To make it worse I took their survey to \"help them serve me better\" and there was no part were I could leave a message it was just cluttered with same frustrating lazy issues, asking me how I heard of bumble but not giving me the staple option of \"other.\" Guess what? I didn't hear about bumble through any of the answers they would let me choose from. Than the survey that's supposed to help improve my experience turns into a questionnaire about how I celebrate Thanksgiving, not that theres anything wrong with that, its just a whole different survey, just make a whole different survey!!! However I don't like leaving things on a sour note, so I will mention the one thing I can say earns them the one star rating (without it they'd be at a accurate -1 stars) and that would be \"bumblebizz\" the networking part of bumble, I can definetly see how the app can help you connect and network. To sum it up bumble is an app I would recommend to no one.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.) Idk who the hell you think you are forcing members to agree with a RACIST/Anti-America BLM but being an anti-racist white guy who is constantly excoriated by racist black ppl I find it the complete opposite of what you claim. The killing of 9 cops and never apologizing for it is scary especially when big companies support these domestic terrorist organizations. Countless anti-white RACIST rhetoric & behavior by BLM! Your business will go broke being this insanely woke! Will delete if not fixed\n",
      "\n",
      "9.) I was blocked for no reason. You cant write messages on here so how can \n",
      "they block someone? I'm a very nice guy n bumble wont respond to my emails \n",
      "since I'm trying to find out what happened. Makes no sense. I feel like I'm \n",
      "being slandered. If bumble wants to reply please do so by email not here. I \n",
      "did not do the upgrade again. Some women are fake, one said she wanted to \n",
      "meet me i wasn't interested so maybe thats why i was blocked n the woman \n",
      "complained. Bumble did not explain anything to me . Makes no sense why they \n",
      "are treating me like this way. Maybe cuz im not a trump supporter!!!!! I \n",
      "set the location within locally to me in NJ but when i checked settings it \n",
      "goes to 70 miles by itself n it was not fixed yet. I'm not driving 70 \n",
      "miles. Bumble does not listen to both sides. They just block for no reason. \n",
      "Update 4/26/18...bumble admitted to me they made a mistake n an employee \n",
      "blocked me by mistake so if ur blocked fight it !!! I knew i did nothing \n",
      "wrong. The employee should be fired..! All this could have been avoided. \n",
      "They are at fault.\n",

      "10.) Dear Bumble.. I have have sent 10 mails in 6days but your customer service is sleeping no response.. You guyz r fooling public.. Payment done.. Amount debited from bank.. But no receipt.. Its been 5 days.. R u guys alive.. No response Or no money credited..Return my money back.. .. Left a message with customer service but useless... Its a cheat.. You customer service is so bad..

      "be able to leave a free message to. Thanks for your immediate reply, but \n",

      "sorry I sound cheap but I have had luck on free sites finding someone, but \n",
      "I thought I'll check out who's on here, as well, to expand my horizons \n",
      "maybe that \"special one\" can be found on here.\n",

      "2.) awesome, can't wait to meet someone for me but so far so good.Thanks alot especially these times..Thanks so much Bumble and the amazing woman who brought hers from india.. Love those beautiful dark hair dark eyed pretty sweet eomen.. so taking it slow but hope to meet a great one out there..well all women are great but one for me... ;). sassy classy sexy types on here.. muah\n",
      "\n",
      "3.) I'm more interested in what you like but I like eating I like having dinner and I like having a social talk I like to get to know the person that I would love to date I don't like getting beautiful heart I like to laugh sometimes joke I like to see the smile on other people so tell me some of the things about you the most interesting things and night date. I like dressing up and jeans I like to be comfortable about yourself relax not hang out too tight with a little loose That's My style I hope\n",
      "\n",
      "4.) I'm surprised but happy, I honestly wasn't looking for a relationship, I'll admit I was looking for a friend with benefits but I met my boyfriend and even liked him so much that I moved to San Diego with him 😂 Now don't get me wrong, there were some duds, some dicks and ghosters, but this app is great. I even use the best friend function and made three best friends from it as well! I'll also admit that some of the girls just use you to get insta followers though lol\n",
      "\n",
      "5.) I like that it is up to the women to speak first because it is challenging and I can control the conversation. I met a lot of great people that I speak with still on Snap. The Friend and Biz versions are dumb, but with Bumble Date, I met my best friend of two years now (a guy) and my current boyfriend of 4 months, who is absolutely perfectly matched with me. It took about two years on the app, but I am finally deleting, a happy ex-user. Good luck to all. Love each other and stay safe! 💙\n",
      "\n",
      "6.) So I like it, but I don't like it. The overall concept works quite well. \n",
      "The app functions smoothly. Easy interface. Attractive and divers matches \n",
      "are availible. I, personally, much prefer messeging someone then being \n",
      "bombarded with messeges. So there are some great possitives. But there are \n",
      "also negatives. If you're super into swipe culture then this app is for \n",
      "you. However, if you like to have a gauge on your matches based on common \n",
      "interests (like me) then you're going to find this app tedious. There is a \n",
      "very limited amount of room for a bio, and no compatibility feature so it's \n",
      "difficult to determin if you'd have many common interests with you match. I \n",
      "completley get why they did this: to cut back on inordinately long bios, \n",
      "and force people to, actually, talk to one another. However, if you have \n",
      "uncommon interests it's a challenge to find a compatible match. On top of \n",
      "that a lot of gentlemen choose not to write a bio... There's no indication \n",
      "of what type of relationship someone's looking for, what a person's \n",
      "political stances are, or even whether or not a person has or wants kids. \n",
      "So if your matches don't indicate these things in their bio, you might be \n",
      "faced with a lot of difficult conversations at some point... And a lot of \n",
      "wasted time. To improve the app I would reccomend making it a requirement \n",
      "to put *somthing* in the bio before a profile goes public. Also, if you \n",
      "have a mutual match you should then be able to see a more detailed profile, \n",
      "or longer bio so you can determine if you want to continue to persue the \n",
      "match or allow the match to expire. Because, lets face it, if you're not \n",
      "just on this app for fun, deal breakers, are deal breakers. Other then the \n",
      "fact you have to browse profiles like your life depends on it to find \n",
      "common ground, the app is pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.) Superb experience... Better crowd than tinder till date. Less dust. More grain. Overall UI is Okeish but lacks dark mode. Great that I can quote text to reply. These are small things in UI that are useful. Dark mode or different color mode in & out of dark mode like messanger will be great to improve overall experience. Improve the filters & their efficiency, like the location range filter. I should also be able to select regions in the city rather than just random distance based. Good Luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.) Well this app seemed like a good alternative to other dating sites but as I \n",
      "learn more about it the more I resent it. Let me explain and borrow from \n",
      "article and people ghatbwrigr code have stated. Apparently the better more \n",
      "attractive girls are put on your list first. So naturally they have far \n",
      "more likes than guys. Guys will play the numbers game and swipe every one \n",
      "just cause it's faster and easier to wait for a match then a subsequent \n",
      "response. The draw back is the girl doesn't actually know who is into them \n",
      "for real and who is playing the numbers game. That said, the standard is \n",
      "the guy initiates the women chooses the partner and that's shown with a \n",
      "bunch of data. Women don't even need to have anything interesting stall in \n",
      "their profile to gwtbattention. They just have to look like a women and \n",
      "they get instant attention. It's very shallow and reveals the real nature \n",
      "of women especially those with above average looks. This gives them a false \n",
      "sense of self importance they think they have a lot more options than they \n",
      "actually do and as such hold out longer or don't respond to someone that \n",
      "already liked them. I get 20% of women will get 80% of the messages and I'm \n",
      "sure it's annoying and overwhelming at times. The reality is this type of \n",
      "attention skews reality with a narcisstic fantasy. This is the crux of many \n",
      "apps and dating in general. Women don't have to put in much effort at all \n",
      "in dating and will still get undeserved attention for lack listed \n",
      "personality. Im spwaking in generalities for a reason since there is \n",
      "studies and examples barking this up. Google it until Google starts \n",
      "censoring. Yes some women are kind and sweet and not full of themselves and \n",
      "healthy fan be rude and crass when hitting on women but the majority is \n",
      "what I am referring to mostly. For women out there. Beauty fades work on a \n",
      "personality get over yourself. Men stop putting undeserving women on \n",
      "pedestools. Unless you aren't look for wife and mother material. My only \n",
      "deal breakers are being lagerly overweight and if you already have a kid. \n",
      "I've gotten better quality people and dates on okc and even tinder. I may \n",
      "be in a minority about looking to actually date and not just saying I am so \n",
      "I can hook up. 😕\n",
      "\n",
      "9.) Better than the others. The primary reason is simply that women are required, and only women may make the first move in making contact. That simple rule is HUGE! No gross, unwelcomed, random contact from an unmanageable thousands of guys for even moderately attractive women. That fact alone should make it even more popular than tinder which provides only about half as much comfort in introduction. Women only get contacted by guys they have already decided might be a prospect for whom the feeling is also mutual as the men of course only have 24 hours to express that interest to keep them from being \"possibility collectors\". The concept is perfect. The execution leaves a bit to be desired though. I grant great leeway for the app's occasional bugi-ness. Bumble's main downside is the Tinder-esque lack of ability to refresh through the stack of those profiles potentially missed the first time you swept past them. Getting a small handful of like 2 to 5 new profiles to see per day after maxing out on the profiles one is allowed to see in their que (even for full paying members) is much worse than Tinder which makes it feel pretty useless after the initial encouragement one feels in the successful first couple of weeks when your profile is still in circulation. Given so many nefarious ploys used by software firms these days, I am left with the distinct suspicion that the initial success a user feels with Bumble followed by the sudden, inexplicable vanishing of about 95% of the profiles to review and 100% of connection frequency/interest is likely not an isolated experience for me. Rather, it is the result of a sophisticated formula designed to extract revenue in the duplicitous tradition of modern American business and advertising - especially in the tech industry. As potentially underhanded as they might be, however, Bumble is still the best option out there. Someday, if a dating app comes along that is able to find a clever way to reduce the problems of \"ghosting\", \"catfishing\" and also has an even marginally effective way to cupid together good compatible connections instead of disingenuously claiming that their 'computers' magically match potential couples, those developers will surely take over the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.) Definitely hate that you have to pay but other than that it's a pretty good app The women on here are beautiful it's definitely more of a relationship type of app versus tender being more of a hookup one night stand kind of at I recommend if you're looking for a relationship that you download this at if you're looking for a booty call I definitely recommend tinder but other than that the women are definitely more classy than tender women Don't get me wrong tinder has classy women but you know\n",

      "1.) CON JOB - PAID FOR 3 MONTHS BUT THEN BANNED FOR NO REASON. NO REFUND AND REFUSED TO AWNSER MY EMAILS. TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL AND DO NOT RECOMMEND. ALSO APP IS RIDDLED WITH BUGS. no feedback was given on the ban and you have to through this painful process to appeal against it to which they dont bothered responding. Its a really harsh way of doing things on this site. NO WARNING just instant ban even to paying members. Utter joke and in my opinion done on purpose get money from you.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.) I had written a decent review but since I was randomly BANNED from using this app I thought I'd update it. No idea why I was banned, it only says I violated terms of service, but I have no clue how. You are allowed to send 1 request to appeal the ban, which I did with no response. This also happened to my cousin, she also never received a response to her appeal. 1 year later and I'm still not allowed to login to the app, and still have absolutely no idea how I violated terms of service. Bummer\n",
      "\n",
      "3.) What a joke. Got banned for 'violation of terms of service' after I called them out for only bots! Don't use this stupid ass app because there is a reason it's designed to be deleted. Its fake, boring, stupid, poorly designed, full of malware and all around a dumb ass idea. F these B's. POF sucks ass and I'd choose that over this waste of app space anyday.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.) Thought I found the 1, but it was a scam. DO NOT believe anyone talking about crypto. I lost $20k on a fake app this person recommended. Look up Pigbutchering Scam. Other than the scam - men don't know what they want or if they just want hookups, they're not honest, they play games. I had to be direct asking questions to cut throb BS. They also ghost. No one takes this serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.) Hinge is VIOLATING GPDR! Legitmate appeals getting ignored! GPDR requests get falsely denied! I have used Hinge for several weeks as intended to find good dates. In my area it's only rarely used so I had approx. 15 matches out of 50 available people in my area. With some of the matches I had really nice dates. I want to point this out here, because I really intended to use Hinge as it's designed for and expected to use. Keep this in mind, it will become important soon. Due to low popularity I didn't use it for weeks and only made some time to time checks for new people. I received a response from someone, who deleted the app earlier but reinstalled it, so we decided to meet. The meet turned out we didn't fit together, that's fine. That's life. Wasn't the first and will probably not the last time. In the same evening that lady unmatched me, which is also fine. But: In the next day my account was banned for no apparent reason. Due to no usage for weeks there can only be one conclusion: The lady must have filed a false report about me, and Hinge didn't check this. Besides this, one single report is enough to get banned for no reason. Of course I immediately filed a legitimate appeal. This appeal has never been answered after 5 months, also not after sending a reminder. Due to not receiving a response I filed a GPDR request to get my data, because if Hinge provides all data, it must contain information about my ban. This request was also unanswered for weeks and only after sending a reminder i got asked to upload an ID to verify myself. No problem, i have done this. Again weeks later I received a denial of my request because my provided data mismatch with the account. This is obviously a wrong answer since this is truly my account and I communicated to Hinge via the email address and phone number I used in this account so this response is absolutely invalid. I have returned it and set a deadline of 14 days to provide my data and delete it afterwards. This has also not been answered. Therefore I have now started to take legal actions. A case has been opened to the Republic of Ireland Data Protection Agency, while my lawyer will check the next steps. This app has also been flagged as inappropriate to Google for it's developers GPDR violation. Long story short: Get prepared to get banned for no reason If you are serious about your private data, don't use Hinge or get ready, that you have to enforce your requests by taking legal actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.) Good concept. But there is a weird feature where when you unmatch somebody, they can still contact you. It makes harassment situations very hard to get out of. The call feature is also awful for harassment. I had a man call me 13 times in a row, because his opening message was an insult, and I expressed discomfort with the fact. You need to add more to protect both men, women, and others from harassment. It should be straightforward and fast acting if you unmatch somebody. Maybe a block button.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.) Got banned for reporting someone that was using a fake account. I appealed this since I reported them, but I was the one that got banned. After I emailed them they didn't fix it and kept the ban with a generic response. Someone who actually spent money and was active got banned makes no sense especially when I broke no rules. I checked their terms and I broke no rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.) Functionally great app for dating, but stopped using it to take a break a couple of months ago. Just checked it today and found out I had been banned. No explanation, no appeal process. Customer service explictly does not offer support for this. No idea what I have been banned for, as I haven't been using the app in the period in which I was banned. Unforgivably heavy handed and unsubstantiated approach to banning. Highly frustrating experience and cannot recommend as an app.\n",
      "\n",
      "9.) You set your profile to heterosexual, they match you up with Trans gender profiles... I don't have a problem with transgender but it's not my preference, why do they push transgender profile on straight profile?! Deleting app. I sent messages to over 100 girls and none reply, I mean either the profiles are fake or the real profiles are inactive and in either case no match. I have preferred status, I was a sucker and actually paid for this stupid app. I regret paying for this stupid useless app.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.) This app is a scam! They shadow ban you for no reason and then when you reach out to customer service, they ignore you after you verify your account with them. I'm glad to stop using an app that has such terrible policies in place to perpetuate cancel culture. They allow abusers on their app but punish the victims of abuse. So very disgusted with their policies and practices.\n",

      "1.) Best dating app I've used by far, in fact, Hinge made me stop using dating apps altogether!    The UI is good, (chat not very much) but the good thing about hinge is seeing quite easily who have liked you, and which photo/thing about you they've liked. The three questions/answers part is a really good conversation starter too.   Giving people the option to filter out others based on things you like/dislike (smoking for example) is a very good thing, it might result in less likes but the quality is much better.  Now the subjective part... It felt like the quality of people I've met there was much better than tinder for example, may be the filters showing people more similar to me or just luck.   I've only stoped using it because I found the best one in there (sorry everyone she is not there anymore!) and things are going amazingly well. So thank you Hinge!  If you are looking for more than sex definitely give Hinge a go!\n",
      "\n",
      "2.) So far it seems like the best dating app to me all true that wasn't appeared at the outside.I appreciate the filter a lot but the mechanism which makes you like more comfortable with this application is on a specific part of profile rather than a generic or dislike helps too much with more people.and for the people complaining about the paid functions obviously when you want to explore more area of the application you have to pay for and I don't bother about it. I am so happy that I got this itsSo far it seems like the best dating app to me all true that wasn't appeared at the outside.I appreciate the filter a lot but the mechanism which makes you like more comfortable with this application is on a specific part of profile rather than a generic or dislike helps too much with more people.and for the people complaining about the paid functions obviously when you want to explore more area of the application you have to pay for and I don't bother about it.

      "\n",
      "3.) I met my fiance on Hinge 2 years ago and deleted the app after a month of use. The app either works great or I finally got lucky/was ready. I don't know if it will be the same for everyone (took me 12 years to find him!), but I think getting yourself out there will defs increase your chances of meeting who you are looking for, and it's a great step to take. If nothing else, you can get self discovery and fun while on the journey 😘 Love is wonderful, wishing you happiness and good luck!\n",
      "\n",
      "4.) Great app, to be honest not been on maybe but this is by far the best, lay out is great with so many ways to set your profile with cheeky ice breaker questions and the opportunity to like a specific photo on a profile gives another ice breaker dynamic. Constant users of the app will be rewarded with services that you have to pay for or for a month free which is a nice touch ..worth a go!\n",
      "\n",
      "5.) I love it! It's very well structured, you answer very few fun questions, yet they give you a good idea of each person. The \"like something\" approach is amazing at feeling free to browse about and only commit if they like you back. Overall great at keeping it fun, thoughful, and keeping overthinking and overcomplicating at bay :-) Edit: Still the best dating app out there, I may buy Premium just to show my support!\n",
      "\n",
      "6.) Not sure what anyone else is saying. Dont really care just speaking about my personal experiences with this app. Tried free, tl;dr free was garbage. Paid for it and huge success. Every person I decided was worth a date turned out to be amazing. Straight up, i actually met someone that motivated me to delete the app. Same girl for almost 6 months now. Regardless of the future, im enjoying every moment in the present. Be kind, respectful, fearless, and importantly honest. Good luck\n",
      "\n",
      "7.) At first I had trouble finding people I like, but then I put my range down so that it wasn't as wide, and I started to find a lot of cute girls who were fun to talk to. I think Hinge is definitely the best app for finding genuine people, plus I like that fact that I can send a message with a like, it allows me to woo them with a joke or a comment on something that we share an interest for.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.) Ive meet some amazing, amazing people here. What's lovely about this app is everyone is very diversified in their own way. The people I met here are so delightful that Ive made lasting friendships on here as a result of dating. ( You know it's good if I say, 'delightful' fr) It's refreshing to hear from dates that if the dating falls through they love to continue a friendship. That's what it's all about- vibing with the right people and this app has been my perfect match!\n",
      "\n",
      "9.) I wasn't sure what this app would be like but was pleasantly surprised on how easy the app is to use. I met a couple of cute guys on here but you can match with women or men on here. It is free to use for a while but you can't send messages or likes without a premium account. The search preferences are nice. I'm overall very happy to filter out people that I don't have interests in and I'm happy so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.) Very easy and fun to me. For the free option you get a certain amount of likes you can send to people a day. The people who liked you. You could decide if you like them too and start chatting for free or just X them out(sorry). It's amazing how fast I got alot of responses and there are so many great amazing guys. I am very hopeful that I will find my soulmate/other half.\n",
